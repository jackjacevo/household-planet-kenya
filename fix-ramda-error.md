# Fix for Ramda Error

The `R.map is not a function` error is caused by cached build files. 

## Quick Fix:

1. **Clear Next.js cache:**
   ```bash
   cd household-planet-frontend
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Or restart the development server:**
   - Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
   - Start it again: `npm run dev`

## Root Cause:
- The error was from old cached JavaScript files that referenced Ramda
- All API endpoints have been fixed to use correct routes
- No Ramda dependency exists in the current codebase

## Fixed API Endpoints:
- ✅ Products: `/api/products` (was `/api/admin/products`)
- ✅ Categories: `/api/categories` (was `/api/admin/categories`) 
- ✅ Brands: `/api/products/brands` (was `/api/admin/brands`)
- ✅ ProductForm: Updated to use correct endpoints
- ✅ BulkActions: Updated to use correct endpoints

**The error should disappear after clearing the cache and restarting the dev server.**
