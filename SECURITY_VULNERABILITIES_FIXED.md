# Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that have been addressed in the Household Planet Kenya e-commerce platform.

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### 1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection Enhanced

**Issue**: Missing comprehensive CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced CSRF guard with double-submit cookie pattern
- Added origin validation for API requests
- Implemented secure logging for CSRF attempts
- Created dedicated CSRF controller for token generation
- Added JWT token format validation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/security/guards/csrf.guard.ts` - Enhanced with comprehensive validation
- `src/security/csrf.controller.ts` - New controller for token management
- `src/security/security.module.ts` - Added new services and controllers

**Key Features**:
- Double-submit cookie pattern for API endpoints
- Origin header validation
- Session-based CSRF tokens for web forms
- Secure token generation and validation
- Comprehensive security event logging

### 2. Log Injection Vulnerabilities Fixed

**Issue**: Unsanitized user input in log statements
**Solution**:
- Enhanced log sanitization service with comprehensive pattern filtering
- Added protection against CRLF injection, control characters, and malicious patterns
- Implemented sensitive field masking
- Added request sanitization for logging
- Enhanced error sanitization

**Files Modified**:
- `src/security/log-sanitizer.service.ts` - Comprehensive enhancement
- `src/security/secure-logger.service.ts` - Already had good sanitization

**Key Features**:
- CRLF injection prevention
- Control character filtering
- Template literal and command substitution protection
- Sensitive field redaction (passwords, tokens, secrets)
- Request data sanitization
- Error message sanitization
- Depth-limited object sanitization to prevent recursion

### 3. HTTPS Enforcement Enhanced

**Issue**: Inadequate HTTPS enforcement and clear text transmission
**Solution**:
- Created dedicated HTTPS redirect middleware
- Enhanced security headers for HTTPS requests
- Improved SSL setup script with comprehensive error handling
- Added HSTS headers with preload directive

**Files Modified**:
- `src/security/https-redirect.middleware.ts` - New middleware for HTTPS enforcement
- `src/main.ts` - Enhanced with new middleware and security headers
- `infrastructure/security/ssl-setup.sh` - Comprehensive error handling

**Key Features**:
- Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection (301 permanent)
- HSTS headers with preload and includeSubDomains
- Enhanced SSL certificate validation
- Comprehensive SSL setup with error recovery
- Certificate auto-renewal with logging

### 4. Shell Script Error Handling Improved

**Issue**: Inadequate error handling in shell scripts
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling with trap functions
- Implemented validation functions for environment checks
- Added backup and recovery mechanisms
- Enhanced logging with rotation
- Added service verification and final validation

**Files Modified**:
- `infrastructure/security/server-hardening.sh` - Complete rewrite with error handling
- `infrastructure/security/ssl-setup.sh` - Enhanced with comprehensive error handling

**Key Features**:
- Error trapping with cleanup functions
- Environment validation before execution
- Automatic backup creation
- Service status verification
- Comprehensive logging with rotation
- Recovery mechanisms for failed operations
- Final verification steps

## Security Enhancements Summary

### CSRF Protection
- ✅ Double-submit cookie pattern
- ✅ Origin validation
- ✅ Session-based tokens
- ✅ JWT format validation
- ✅ Security event logging

### Log Security
- ✅ CRLF injection prevention
- ✅ Control character filtering
- ✅ Sensitive data masking
- ✅ Pattern-based filtering
- ✅ Depth-limited sanitization

### HTTPS Security
- ✅ Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- ✅ HSTS with preload
- ✅ Enhanced security headers
- ✅ Certificate validation
- ✅ Auto-renewal setup

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Environment validation
- ✅ Backup and recovery
- ✅ Service verification
- ✅ Logging and monitoring

## Testing Recommendations

1. **CSRF Testing**:
   - Test state-changing requests without CSRF tokens
   - Verify double-submit cookie validation
   - Test origin header validation

2. **Log Injection Testing**:
   - Attempt CRLF injection in user inputs
   - Test with control characters and malicious patterns
   - Verify sensitive data masking

3. **HTTPS Testing**:
   - Test HTTP to HTTPS redirection
   - Verify HSTS headers
   - Test certificate validation

4. **Infrastructure Testing**:
   - Test script error scenarios
   - Verify backup and recovery mechanisms
   - Test service failure handling

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# CSRF Protection
TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://householdplanet.co.ke,https://www.householdplanet.co.ke

# SSL Configuration (Production)
SSL_KEY_PATH=/etc/letsencrypt/live/householdplanet.co.ke/privkey.pem
SSL_CERT_PATH=/etc/letsencrypt/live/householdplanet.co.ke/fullchain.pem

# Security
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Deployment Notes

1. **CSRF Tokens**: Frontend applications need to request CSRF tokens from `/csrf/token` endpoint
2. **HTTPS**: Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured before enabling HTTPS enforcement
3. **Logging**: Monitor logs for security events and failed CSRF attempts
4. **Scripts**: Run infrastructure scripts with proper permissions and in correct environment

## Monitoring

The enhanced security features include comprehensive logging for:
- CSRF protection attempts and failures
- Security header violations
- HTTPS redirection events
- Authentication and authorization events
- File operations and database access

Monitor these logs regularly for security incidents and potential attacks.
