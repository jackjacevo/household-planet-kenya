# Image Display Fix Summary

## What was fixed:

1. **Created proper hero background image**: 
   - Created `/images/hero-bg.svg` with beautiful household-themed gradient design
   - Updated all banners in database to use this SVG

2. **Created category-specific product placeholders**:
   - `/images/products/kitchen-placeholder.svg` - Kitchen-themed placeholder
   - `/images/products/bathroom-placeholder.svg` - Bathroom-themed placeholder
   - Updated products in database to use appropriate placeholders

3. **Fixed image URLs in database**:
   - All banners now use `/images/hero-bg.svg`
   - Kitchen products use `/images/products/kitchen-placeholder.svg`
   - Bathroom products use `/images/products/bathroom-placeholder.svg`
   - Other products use `/images/products/placeholder.svg`

## Files created/updated:
- `household-planet-frontend/public/images/hero-bg.svg`
- `household-planet-frontend/public/images/products/kitchen-placeholder.svg`
- `household-planet-frontend/public/images/products/bathroom-placeholder.svg`
- Database records updated with correct image paths

## Next steps:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5)
2. **Refresh the page** to see the new images
3. The hero carousel should now show the gradient background
4. Product cards should show category-specific placeholder images

## If images still don't show:
1. Check browser developer tools (F12) for any 404 errors
2. Verify the frontend server is serving static files correctly
3. Check if there are any CORS issues in the browser console

The images should now display properly with beautiful placeholders instead of blank spaces!
