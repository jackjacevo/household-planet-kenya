# Order Pages Delivery Cost Update Summary

## Changes Made

Updated all order-related pages to properly display and calculate delivery costs with consistent formatting.

### 1. Customer Orders Page (`/account/orders/page.tsx`)
- Changed "Shipping:" to "Delivery Cost:"
- Added "FREE" display when delivery cost is 0
- Shows exact delivery cost from selected location

### 2. Order Confirmation Page (`/order-confirmation/[orderId]/page.tsx`)
- Updated order summary to show "Delivery Cost" instead of "Delivery"
- Added "FREE" display when delivery cost is 0
- Enhanced delivery information section to show cost consistently

### 3. Admin Orders Page (`/admin/orders/page.tsx`)
- Updated delivery cost display in order items section
- Shows "FREE" when delivery cost is 0
- Consistent "Delivery:" labeling

## Display Logic

All pages now follow this consistent pattern:

```typescript
{order.shippingCost === 0 ? (
  <span className="text-green-600 font-medium">FREE</span>
) : (
  formatPrice(order.shippingCost)
)}
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Labeling**: All pages use "Delivery Cost" terminology
2. **Clear Free Shipping**: Shows "FREE" in green when delivery cost is 0
3. **Accurate Pricing**: Displays exact delivery cost from selected location
4. **Better UX**: Users can easily see delivery costs across all order views

## Pages Updated

- ✅ Customer Orders History (`/account/orders`)
- ✅ Order Confirmation (`/order-confirmation/[orderId]`)
- ✅ Admin Orders Management (`/admin/orders`)
- ✅ Checkout Process (previously updated)

All order-related pages now consistently show and calculate delivery costs based on the selected delivery location's specific price, with clear indication when delivery is free.
