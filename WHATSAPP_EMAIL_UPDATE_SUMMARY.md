# WhatsApp Order Email Field Update

## Summary
Updated the WhatsApp order creation system to include an optional Gmail/email input field instead of always using temporary WhatsApp emails.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
**File:** `household-planet-frontend/src/components/admin/WhatsAppOrderEntry.tsx`

1. **Added email field to form schema:**
   - Added `customerEmail` field with email validation
   - Made it optional with empty string fallback

2. **Updated form UI:**
   - Added email input field after name and phone
   - Added helpful description text
   - Added informational note at the top of the form

3. **Enhanced user experience:**
   - Clear labeling that email is optional
   - Explanation of what happens when email is provided vs not provided

### Backend Changes
**File:** `household-planet-backend/src/orders/dto/order.dto.ts`

1. **Updated DTO:**
   - Added optional `customerEmail` field to `CreateWhatsAppOrderDto`
   - Proper validation with `@IsOptional()` and `@IsString()`

**File:** `household-planet-backend/src/orders/whatsapp.service.ts`

1. **Enhanced user creation logic:**
   - Uses provided email if available, otherwise creates temp WhatsApp email
   - Searches for existing users by both phone and email
   - Updates existing WhatsApp temp users with real email when provided

2. **Improved order notes:**
   - Includes information about whether real email or temp email was used
   - Better tracking of customer email status

## Behavior

### When Email is Provided:
- Creates customer with the provided Gmail/email address
- If customer exists with temp WhatsApp email, upgrades them to real email
- Order notes indicate real email was provided

### When Email is NOT Provided:
- Creates customer with temporary WhatsApp email format: `{phone}@whatsapp.temp`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing system
- Order notes indicate temporary email was used

## Customer Management Impact

The customer management page now shows:
- Real customers with Gmail addresses
- WhatsApp customers with temp emails (can be toggled on/off)
- Visual indicators for WhatsApp vs regular customers
- Upgrade path from temp to real email when orders include email

## Testing

Created test script: `test-whatsapp-email-order.js`
- Tests order creation with Gmail
- Tests order creation without email (temp email)
- Verifies customer creation and updates

## Benefits

1. **Better Customer Data:** Real email addresses for better communication
2. **Backward Compatibility:** Still works without email input
3. **Customer Upgrade Path:** Temp customers can be upgraded to real customers
4. **Improved Tracking:** Clear distinction between temp and real customers
5. **Enhanced Admin Experience:** Better customer management and filtering

## Usage Instructions

### For Admin Staff:
1. Go to Admin → WhatsApp Management → Create Order
2. Fill in customer phone and name (required)
3. **NEW:** Optionally add customer email address
4. Complete rest of order details as before
5. Submit order

### Result:
- If email provided: Customer gets real email address
- If no email: Customer gets temp WhatsApp email (as before)
- All existing functionality remains the same
