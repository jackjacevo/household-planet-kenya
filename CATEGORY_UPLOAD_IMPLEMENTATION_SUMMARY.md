# OR restart the service however it's deployed
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Credentials
- **Email**: `householdplanet819@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `Admin@2025`

### Test Script
A test script has been created (`test-category-upload.js`) that:
1. Logs in with admin credentials
2. Tests the category image upload endpoint
3. Creates a test category with the uploaded image

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Go to `https://householdplanetkenya.co.ke/admin/categories`
2. Click "Add Parent Category" or "Add Subcategory"
3. Fill in category details
4. Click "Choose Image" to upload a category image
5. Verify the image uploads and displays correctly
6. Save the category and verify it appears with the image

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart Backend Service** - This is the critical step to enable upload functionality

3. **Verify Image Storage** - Ensure uploaded images are properly stored and accessible
4. **Test Category CRUD** - Verify all category operations work correctly

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Upload Still Fails After Restart
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify the `uploads` directory exists and is writable
3. Check CORS configuration for file uploads
4. Verify JWT authentication is working

### Common Issues
- **404 on upload endpoint**: Backend not restarted
- **CORS errors**: Check CORS configuration in main.ts
- **File too large**: Check file size limits
- **Authentication errors**: Verify JWT token is valid

## 📁 File Structure

```
uploads/
├── categories/          # Category images
├── products/           # Product images
└── user-uploads/       # General user uploads
```

Images are served statically from `/uploads/` path and stored with unique UUIDs to prevent conflicts.
