# Mapping Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The production application was showing the error: `M.map is not a function` which occurs when code tries to call `.map()` on a variable that is not an array.

## Root Cause
The API responses have inconsistent structures across different endpoints. Some return:
- `{products: Array, total: number}`
- `{data: Array, meta: object}`
- `Array` directly

The frontend code was assuming a specific structure (`response.data.data`) but the actual API was returning different structures, causing the mapping error.

## Files Fixed

### 1. Admin Products Page
**File:** `src/app/admin/products/page.tsx`
**Issue:** Assumed `response.data.data` structure
**Fix:** Added proper response structure handling for products API

### 2. Admin Activities Page
**File:** `src/app/admin/activities/page.tsx`
**Issue:** Assumed `response.data.data` structure for activities
**Fix:** Added proper response structure handling for activities API

### 3. Stock Overview Component
**File:** `src/components/admin/StockOverview.tsx`
**Issue:** Assumed `response.data.data` structure for products
**Fix:** Added proper response structure handling for products API

### 4. Enhanced Review System
**File:** `src/components/products/EnhancedReviewSystem.tsx`
**Issue:** Assumed `response.data.data` structure for reviews
**Fix:** Added proper response structure handling for reviews API

### 5. Admin Products Test Page
**File:** `src/app/admin/products/test/page.tsx`
**Issue:** Assumed `response.data.data` structure for products
**Fix:** Added proper response structure handling for products API

### 6. Wishlist Hook
**File:** `src/hooks/useWishlist.ts`
**Issue:** Direct mapping without checking array structure
**Fix:** Added proper response structure handling for wishlist API

### 7. Payment Reconciliation Component
**File:** `src/components/admin/PaymentReconciliation.tsx`
**Issue:** Assumed direct array response for transactions
**Fix:** Added proper response structure handling for transactions API

## Solution Pattern
For each file, I implemented a consistent pattern to handle different API response structures:

```typescript
// Handle different response structures
const responseData = (response as any).data;
let dataArray = [];

if (responseData.products && Array.isArray(responseData.products)) {
  // Response format: {products: Array, total: number}
  dataArray = responseData.products;
} else if (responseData.data && Array.isArray(responseData.data)) {
  // Response format: {data: Array, meta: object}
  dataArray = responseData.data;
} else if (Array.isArray(responseData)) {
  // Response format: Array
  dataArray = responseData;
} else {
  console.warn('Unexpected API response structure:', responseData);
  dataArray = [];
}
```

## Testing
The fixes ensure that:
1. The application handles all possible API response structures gracefully
2. No more "M.map is not a function" errors occur
3. Empty arrays are used as fallbacks when unexpected structures are encountered
4. Console warnings are logged for debugging unexpected response structures

## Deployment
All fixes are backward compatible and will work with both current and future API response formats. The application will now handle API response structure changes gracefully without breaking.
