# WhatsApp Order Activity Logging Fix

## Issue
WhatsApp orders were being created successfully but were not being recorded in the Admin Activity Log, making it difficult to track when staff members create orders through the WhatsApp interface.

## Root Cause
The `WhatsAppService.createWhatsAppOrder()` method was not integrated with the `ActivityService` to log admin activities when orders were created.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Orders Module (`orders.module.ts`)
- Added `ActivityModule` import to enable activity logging functionality
- This allows the WhatsApp service to access the ActivityService

### 2. Updated WhatsApp Service (`whatsapp.service.ts`)
- Added `ActivityService` injection in the constructor
- Modified `createWhatsAppOrder()` method to accept an optional `adminUserId` parameter
- Added activity logging after successful order creation with the following details:
  - Action: `CREATE_WHATSAPP_ORDER`
  - Order number, customer name, phone, total amount, and delivery location
  - Entity type: `ORDER`
  - Entity ID: The created order's ID

### 3. Updated Orders Controller (`orders.controller.ts`)
- Modified the WhatsApp order creation endpoint to pass the authenticated admin user's ID
- This ensures the activity is logged with the correct user who created the order

## Activity Log Details
When a WhatsApp order is created, the following activity will now be logged:

```json
{
  "action": "CREATE_WHATSAPP_ORDER",
  "details": {
    "orderNumber": "WA-2024-001234",
    "customerName": "Customer Name",
    "customerPhone": "+254712345678",
    "total": 1700,
    "deliveryLocation": "Nairobi CBD"
  },
  "entityType": "ORDER",
  "entityId": 123,
  "userId": 1,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Testing
A test script (`test-whatsapp-activity-logging.js`) has been created to verify the fix:
1. Authenticates as admin
2. Creates a WhatsApp order
3. Checks if the activity was logged in the Admin Activity Log
4. Confirms the activity contains correct details

## Benefits
- ✅ Full audit trail of WhatsApp order creation
- ✅ Ability to track which staff member created each WhatsApp order
- ✅ Better accountability and monitoring
- ✅ Consistent activity logging across all order creation methods
- ✅ No impact on existing functionality

## Files Modified
1. `src/orders/orders.module.ts` - Added ActivityModule import
2. `src/orders/whatsapp.service.ts` - Added activity logging functionality
3. `src/orders/orders.controller.ts` - Pass admin user ID for logging

The fix is minimal, focused, and maintains backward compatibility while adding the missing activity logging functionality.
