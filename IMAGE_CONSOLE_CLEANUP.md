# Image Console Cleanup Implementation

## Problem
Base64 image data was being logged to the console, making it messy and potentially exposing sensitive data.

## Solution Implemented

### Frontend (Next.js)
1. **Enhanced Console Filter in layout.tsx**: Added comprehensive filtering for base64 data in console output
2. **LogSanitizer Utility**: Created `/src/lib/logSanitizer.ts` to sanitize console logs
3. **Simplified Image Upload Logging**: Reduced verbose logging in `ImageUpload.tsx`

### Backend (NestJS)
1. **Enhanced Console Filter in main.ts**: Improved existing base64 filtering
2. **LogSanitizer Utility**: Created `/src/common/utils/log-sanitizer.ts` for backend logging
3. **Console Override**: Created `/src/common/utils/console-override.ts` for production use
4. **Simplified Upload Logging**: Reduced verbose logging in upload controllers and services

## Key Changes

### Console Output Filtering
- Base64 data URLs are replaced with `data:image/[BASE64_HIDDEN]`
- Long base64 strings are replaced with `[BASE64_DATA:length_chars]`
- Buffer objects are replaced with `[BUFFER:length_bytes]`
- File upload logs now show file count instead of detailed file objects

### Files Modified
- `household-planet-frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`
- `household-planet-frontend/src/components/admin/ImageUpload.tsx`
- `household-planet-backend/src/main.ts`
- `household-planet-backend/src/upload/upload.controller.ts`
- `household-planet-backend/src/admin/admin.controller.ts`
- `household-planet-backend/src/common/services/secure-upload.service.ts`

### New Files Created
- `household-planet-frontend/src/lib/logSanitizer.ts`
- `household-planet-backend/src/common/utils/log-sanitizer.ts`
- `household-planet-backend/src/common/utils/console-override.ts`

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner Console**: No more messy base64 data in console output
2. **Security**: Prevents accidental exposure of image data in logs
3. **Performance**: Reduced console output improves performance
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to debug with clean, readable logs

## Usage
The filtering is automatic and requires no additional configuration. All console.log, console.error, and console.warn calls are automatically filtered.

## Environment Variables
- `SANITIZE_LOGS=true` - Force log sanitization in development (backend)
- Production mode automatically enables log sanitization

## Original Functionality Preserved
- All image upload functionality remains unchanged
- Error handling and debugging capabilities are maintained
- Only console output is cleaned up, not actual functionality
