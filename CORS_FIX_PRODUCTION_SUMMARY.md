# CORS Fix for Production - Summary

## Issue
The browser was blocking requests from `https://householdplanetkenya.co.ke` to `https://api.householdplanetkenya.co.ke` due to missing or incorrect CORS headers.

## Root Cause
1. CORS configuration was not properly handling both www and non-www versions of the domain
2. Environment variables were not correctly parsing multiple origins
3. CORS headers were not being set consistently across all endpoints

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend CORS Configuration (`household-planet-backend/src/main.ts`)
- ✅ Updated CORS origins to handle comma-separated values from environment variables
- ✅ Added better logging for CORS debugging
- ✅ Improved preflight request handling (OPTIONS method)
- ✅ Added proper CORS headers for all endpoints
- ✅ Temporarily allowing all origins for debugging (should be reverted after testing)

### 2. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Updated `.env.production` files to include both www and non-www domains
- ✅ Set `CORS_ORIGIN=https://householdplanetkenya.co.ke,https://www.householdplanetkenya.co.ke`

### 3. Docker Configuration
- ✅ Updated `docker-compose.prod.yml` to include both domains in CORS_ORIGIN

### 4. Testing & Deployment Scripts
- ✅ Created `test-cors-production.js` for testing CORS configuration
- ✅ Created `fix-cors-deployment.sh` for automated deployment

## Deployment Steps

1. **Apply the changes:**
   ```bash
   # Run the deployment script
   chmod +x fix-cors-deployment.sh
   ./fix-cors-deployment.sh
   ```

2. **Or manually deploy:**
   ```bash
   cd household-planet-backend
   npm run build
   
   # If using Docker
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
   
   # If using PM2
   pm2 restart household-planet-backend
   ```

3. **Test the fix:**
   ```bash
   node test-cors-production.js
   ```

## Expected Results

After deployment, the following should work:
- ✅ Frontend can make API requests to backend
- ✅ CORS headers are properly set for all responses
- ✅ Both www and non-www domains are allowed
- ✅ Preflight OPTIONS requests are handled correctly

## CORS Headers Now Included

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://householdplanetkenya.co.ke
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH,OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,Authorization,Accept,Cache-Control,Pragma,X-Requested-With,Origin,Access-Control-Request-Method,Access-Control-Request-Headers
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```

## Security Note

⚠️ **Important**: The current configuration temporarily allows all origins for debugging. After confirming the fix works, revert the following line in `main.ts`:

```typescript
// Change this back to:
callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
// Instead of:
callback(null, true); // Temporarily allow all origins for debugging
```

## Verification

Test the CORS fix by:
1. Opening browser developer tools
2. Navigating to `https://householdplanetkenya.co.ke`
3. Checking that API requests no longer show CORS errors
4. Verifying response headers include proper CORS headers
