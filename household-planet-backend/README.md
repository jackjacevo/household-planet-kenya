# File Upload Security Implementation

## Features Implemented

### 1. File Type Validation and Restriction
- Magic number validation using `file-type` library
- MIME type verification
- Allowed types: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, PDF, TXT

### 2. Virus Scanning
- Basic pattern matching for suspicious content
- EICAR test file detection
- Script injection prevention

### 3. File Size Limits and Storage Quotas
- 10MB maximum file size
- 100 files per user quota
- Real-time quota checking

### 4. Secure File Storage with Access Controls
- User-specific directories with restricted permissions (0o700)
- Secure filename generation using crypto
- Access control - users can only access their own files

### 5. Image Optimization and Resizing
- Automatic image optimization using Sharp
- Resize to max 1200x1200 pixels
- JPEG compression at 85% quality

### 6. Secure File Delivery
- Protected file URLs with user authentication
- Rate limiting (10 uploads per minute)
- Secure file serving with access validation

## API Endpoints

### Upload File
```
POST /api/upload
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body: file (multipart)
```

### Get Secure File
```
GET /api/upload/secure/:userId/:filename
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Delete File
```
DELETE /api/upload/:filename
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Security Measures

- JWT authentication required
- Rate limiting on uploads
- File type validation using magic numbers
- Virus scanning for suspicious patterns
- User quota enforcement
- Secure file storage with restricted permissions
- Access control validation
- Automatic image optimization

## Dependencies Added

- `file-type`: File type detection using magic numbers
- `sharp`: Image processing and optimization
- `@types/multer`: TypeScript support for file uploads

## Directory Structure

```
src/upload/
├── dto/
│   └── upload.dto.ts
├── guards/
│   └── file-upload.guard.ts

│   └── file-size.interceptor.ts
├── file-validation.service.ts
├── storage.service.ts

└── upload.module.ts
```

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `npm install file-type sharp @types/multer`
2. The upload module is automatically registered in app.module.ts
3. Files are stored in `./secure-uploads/{userId}/` directory
4. Access files via secure URLs with authentication
