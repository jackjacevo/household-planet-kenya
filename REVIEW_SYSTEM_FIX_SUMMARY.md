# Review System Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing API Methods**
**Problem:** The frontend API client didn't have methods to handle reviews.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive review API methods to `src/lib/api.ts`:
- `createReview(formData)` - Submit new reviews with image upload
- `getProductReviews(productId, page, limit)` - Fetch reviews for a product
- `getReviewStats(productId)` - Get review statistics
- `updateReview(reviewId, data)` - Update existing reviews
- `deleteReview(reviewId)` - Delete reviews

### 2. **Photo Upload Not Working**
**Problem:** Review form wasn't properly handling image uploads.

**Solutions:**
- âœ… Updated `ReviewForm.tsx` to use proper FormData with correct field names
- âœ… Added file validation and size limits (5MB per image, max 3 images)
- âœ… Enhanced backend controller with `FilesInterceptor` for image handling
- âœ… Implemented image saving logic in `ReviewsService` with UUID filenames
- âœ… Created proper upload directory structure (`uploads/reviews/`)

### 3. **Reviews Not Saving**
**Problem:** Review submission wasn't connected to the backend properly.

**Solutions:**
- âœ… Fixed form submission handler in `ReviewForm.tsx`
- âœ… Added proper error handling and user feedback
- âœ… Implemented duplicate review prevention (one review per user per product)
- âœ… Added verification status based on purchase history

### 4. **Reviews Not Displaying**
**Problem:** Reviews weren't being fetched and displayed in the Customer Reviews section.

**Solutions:**
- âœ… Updated product detail page to fetch reviews on load
- âœ… Added review refresh after successful submission
- âœ… Fixed image display in `ReviewsList.tsx` to handle JSON string format
- âœ… Added loading states and error handling
- âœ… Updated TypeScript interfaces to match database schema

### 5. **Backend Configuration**
**Solutions:**
- âœ… Added UUID package for unique filename generation
- âœ… Configured static file serving for uploaded images
- âœ… Added proper CORS headers for image access
- âœ… Implemented file validation and security measures
