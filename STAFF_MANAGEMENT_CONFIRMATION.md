# Staff Management System - Confirmation & Testing Results

## ✅ System Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The Staff Management system has been thoroughly tested and confirmed to be working properly with all required functionality.

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Backend API Tests
- ✅ **Staff Listing**: `/api/admin/staff` - Returns all staff and admin users
- ✅ **Staff Creation**: `POST /api/admin/staff` - Creates new staff members
- ✅ **Admin Creation**: `POST /api/admin/staff` - Creates new admin users
- ✅ **Permission Management**: `PUT /api/admin/staff/:id/permissions` - Updates user permissions
- ✅ **Role-based Access**: Only ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN roles can access staff management

### Frontend Interface Tests
- ✅ **Staff Management Page**: `/admin/staff` - Displays staff list with statistics
- ✅ **Add Staff Dialog**: Modal form for creating new staff members
- ✅ **Admin Creation**: Can create users with ADMIN role
- ✅ **Permission Selection**: Checkbox interface for assigning permissions
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Staff list refreshes after creation

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Authorization Token Issue
**Problem**: Frontend was using incorrect token field name
**Solution**: Updated to use `accessToken` instead of `access_token`

### 2. Database Relation Issue
**Problem**: Staff service was trying to count non-existent `ordersAsCustomer` relation
**Solution**: Fixed to use correct `orders` relation from User model

### 3. Role Access Control
**Problem**: Staff controller only allowed ADMIN role
**Solution**: Added SUPER_ADMIN role to controller permissions

### 4. Error Handling
**Problem**: Generic error handling for duplicate emails
**Solution**: Added proper ConflictException with meaningful messages

### 5. Data Validation
**Problem**: Missing validation for existing users
**Solution**: Added email uniqueness check before creation
