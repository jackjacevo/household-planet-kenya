# Test Login Credentials

## Fixed Issues ✅

### 1. Next.js Image `sizes` Prop Warning
- **Issue**: Image components using `fill` prop were missing the required `sizes` prop
- **Fix**: Updated `SmartImage.tsx` and `ProgressiveImage.tsx` to automatically provide appropriate `sizes` prop when `fill` is used
- **Result**: No more console warnings about missing `sizes` prop

### 2. Authentication 401 Error
- **Issue**: No test user existed in the database
- **Fix**: Created a test user with valid credentials
- **Result**: Authentication now works correctly

## Test Login Credentials

Use these credentials to test the login functionality:

```
Email: test@example.com
Password: password123
```

## How to Test

1. **Start the Backend** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd household-planet-backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd household-planet-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Login**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
   - Enter the test credentials above
   - You should be successfully logged in

## Additional Test Users

If you need more test users, you can create them by running:

```bash
cd household-planet-backend
node create-test-user.js
```

Or modify the script to create users with different roles (ADMIN, STAFF, etc.).

## Verification

The authentication system has been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Login endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ JWT tokens are generated properly  
- ✅ Profile endpoint works with valid tokens
- ✅ User sessions are managed correctly

## Next Steps

1. Use the test credentials to login
2. Test other functionality like adding products to cart
3. Create additional users as needed for testing different roles
