# Critical Security Vulnerabilities - Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities found in the Household Planet Kenya e-commerce platform and the fixes applied to address them.

## 1. Hardcoded Credentials (Critical - CWE-798, CWE-259)

### Issues Found:
- Test files contain hardcoded passwords and API keys
- Frontend components have exposed credentials

### Fixes Applied:
- Removed all hardcoded credentials from source code
- Implemented environment variable usage
- Added .env.example files with placeholder values
- Updated documentation for secure credential management

## 2. NoSQL Injection Vulnerabilities (High - CWE-943)

### Issues Found:
- Multiple service files vulnerable to injection attacks
- User input not properly sanitized before database queries
- Affected files:
  - admin/reporting.service.ts
  - admin/product-management.service.ts
  - payments/flutterwave.service.ts
  - sms/sms.service.ts
  - content/blog.service.ts
  - orders/orders.service.ts
  - compliance/data-retention.service.ts

### Fixes Applied:
- Implemented input validation and sanitization
- Added parameterized queries
- Created validation middleware
- Added input sanitization utilities

## 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High - CWE-352, CWE-1275)

### Issues Found:
- Missing CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
- Test files making unprotected POST/PUT/DELETE requests

### Fixes Applied:
- Implemented CSRF protection middleware
- Added CSRF token generation and validation
- Updated all forms to include CSRF tokens
- Added CSRF configuration to security module

## 4. Log Injection (High - CWE-117)

### Issues Found:
- User inputs logged without sanitization across multiple files
- Can lead to log forging and integrity issues

### Fixes Applied:
- Created log sanitization utility
- Updated all logging statements to sanitize user input
- Implemented structured logging
- Added log validation middleware

## 5. Cross-Origin Communication Issues (High - CWE-346)

### Issues Found:
- Service worker not verifying message origins
- Potential for unauthorized cross-origin access

### Fixes Applied:
- Added origin verification in service worker
- Implemented secure postMessage handling
- Added origin whitelist configuration

## 6. Clear Text Transmission (High - CWE-319)

### Issues Found:
- HTTP requests detected in frontend components
- Sensitive data transmitted without encryption

### Fixes Applied:
- Enforced HTTPS for all API calls
- Added HTTPS redirect middleware
- Updated all HTTP URLs to HTTPS
- Implemented HSTS headers

## 7. Path Traversal Prevention

### Issues Found:
- File upload services potentially vulnerable to path traversal

### Fixes Applied:
- Enhanced filename sanitization
- Added path validation
- Implemented secure file storage
- Added file type validation

## Implementation Status
✅ All critical vulnerabilities have been addressed
✅ Security middleware implemented
✅ Input validation enhanced
✅ Logging security improved
✅ CSRF protection added
✅ HTTPS enforcement implemented

## Next Steps
1. Run security tests to verify fixes
2. Update deployment configuration for HTTPS
3. Review and rotate any exposed credentials
4. Implement regular security audits
5. Add security monitoring and alerting

## Security Best Practices Implemented
- Input validation and sanitization
- Parameterized queries
- CSRF protection
- Secure logging
- HTTPS enforcement
- Origin verification
- File upload security
- Environment variable usage
