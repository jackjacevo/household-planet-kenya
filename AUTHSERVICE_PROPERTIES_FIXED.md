Fixed missing properties and enhanced functionality in the AuthService class.

## Properties Added

### 1. Login Attempt Tracking
```typescript

private readonly maxLoginAttempts = 5;
private readonly lockoutDuration = 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 minutes
```

### 2. Interface Definition
```typescript
interface LoginAttempt {
  count: number;
  lastAttempt: Date;
}
```

## Enhanced Methods
